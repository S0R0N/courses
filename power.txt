 - Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, when in fact the null hypothesis is false.
 - The way the power gets used most often, as at the time of designing the study. You want to design the study, so that you have a reasonable chance of detecting the alternative hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis is true.
 - The probability of a type II error is usually called beta, and Power is just 1 minus beta
 - is a function that depends on the mean under the null hypothesis.
 - is calculated with the same equation than alpha but with mus bigger than the null hipothesis mu.
 - basciamente, poder es la probabilidad de obtener rechaszar la hipotesis nula dada una promedio diferente. 
 - Beta = tipe II error rate. 
 - 1-Beta = Power(Xpromedio> u0+ Zalpha-1*sigma/sqrt(n); u= ua )
 - conocidos, u0, alpha.
 - desconocidos, ua, sigma, n and B. 
 - so, if you suppose the other tree then you can calcute the fourth, for example the n that can give a specific power. 
NOTES
 - Primero se tiene que calcular el alpha, el umbral de rejection or fail to reject despues el beta, depende de la direccion, menos o mayor. 
 - When you're testing not equal to just make sure you use the z1 minus alpha over 2, instead of, z1 minus alpha,
 - power is also equal to sqrt(n)*(ua-u0)/sigma, i.e., (ua-u0)*standard deviation.
 - the quantity  (ua-u0)/sigma is called the effect size, and it can be used to calculate n. 

Calculation
 - Using power.t.test, it calculates the non central t distribution, it is required when u is not u0.
