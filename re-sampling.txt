Resampling based procedures are ways to perform population based statistical inferences, while living within our data
 - called bootstrap
 - I have the sample, but not the population
 - then what I do is, sample my sample (with replacement) many times and calculate the statistics from those samples. 
 - We use our data, our observed data. To construct an estimated population distribution, we simulate from that population distribution to figure out the distribution, of a statistic that we're interested it
 - After reconstructing the boostraped distribution, you can operate over it and calculate confidence intervals and other statistics. 

Nonparametric bootstrp algorithm example
 - sample n observations with replacement from the observed data. 
 - take the median of the simulated data set
 - you repeat this process B times, where B is the number of bootstrapping. 
 - B bigger than 10.000
 - get those medians or calculated statistics and draw an histogram. 
 - calculate their sd 
 - take the 2.5 and 97.5 (both sided. 95% interval) as a confidence interval for the median. bootstrap confidence for the median. 
 - Improved confidence interval using BCA. Bias-corrected and accelerated interval
